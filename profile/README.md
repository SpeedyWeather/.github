# SpeedyWeather
We are an organisation!

## Projects

- [SpeedyWeather.jl](https://github.com/SpeedyWeather/SpeedyWeather.jl), a spectral atmospheric model with simple physics
- [RingGrids](https://speedyweather.github.io/SpeedyWeather.jl/dev/ringgrids/) a library for iso-latitude grids on the sphere and their interpolation (submodule of SpeedyWeather.jl)
- [LowerTriangularMatrices](https://speedyweather.github.io/SpeedyWeather.jl/dev/lowertriangularmatrices/) a library for lower triangular matrices used for the spherical harmonics in SpeedyWeather.jl
- [SpeedyTransforms](https://speedyweather.github.io/SpeedyWeather.jl/dev/speedytransforms/) a library for the spherical harmonic transform between spectral space (using LowerTriangularMatrices) and grid-point space (using RingGrids) used by SpeedyWeather.jl
