# SpeedyWeather
We are an organisation!

## Projects

- [SpeedyWeather.jl](https://github.com/SpeedyWeather/SpeedyWeather.jl), a spectral atmospheric model with simple physics
- [RingGrids](https://speedyweather.github.io/SpeedyWeather.jl/dev/ringgrids/) a library for iso-latitude grids on the sphere (and extended into N-dimensional arrays) and their interpolation for SpeedyWeather.jl
- [LowerTriangularMatrices](https://speedyweather.github.io/SpeedyWeather.jl/dev/lowertriangularmatrices/) a library for lower triangular matrices (and extended into N-dimensional arrays) used for the spherical harmonics in SpeedyWeather.jl
- [SpeedyTransforms](https://speedyweather.github.io/SpeedyWeather.jl/dev/speedytransforms/) a library for the spherical harmonic transform between spectral space (using LowerTriangularMatrices) and grid-point space (using RingGrids) used by SpeedyWeather.jl

## Repositories for model setups

- [StochasticStir.jl](https://github.com/SpeedyWeather/StochasticStir.jl), for stochastic stirring of vorticity in mid-latitudes with a jetstream-dependent drag term.
